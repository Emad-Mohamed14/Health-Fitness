This is Google Colab project.
The title is to determine the number of Steps one should make in a day!
The inputs are taken from user with respect to his BMI and Occupation
This Regression project computed Mean Absolute Error for different Regressors and chose the best one
Decision Tree it Was.
Hyperparameter tuning was done for the same but it increased the MAE maybe due to overfitting.
With the least MAE, here's your Step Count Predictor!
This project is yet to be done on a industry level with more predictions and implemented on app & web.
